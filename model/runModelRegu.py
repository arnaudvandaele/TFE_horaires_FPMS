This script represents the configuration in the section 7.1.2
It is divided in two parts : 
    - SETUP MODEL = All constraints used in the model. Do not change them to get section 7.1.2 results. 
                    Further details are available in the constraints.py module
    - SOLVING AND RESULTS = After solving, results can be displayed or saved. (Un)comment lines to get what you need.

    - segmentSize (1) = size of a segment (i.e. size of 3 means that each segment represents 3 identical weeks)
